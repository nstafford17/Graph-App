0) Open your project

Open VS Code → File → Open Folder… → select your streamlit_app folder.

1) Open the built-in terminal (you’ll run everything here)

VS Code top menu → Terminal → New Terminal
You should see a terminal at the bottom, already in your project folder.

2) Activate your virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate


You’ll know it worked if your prompt starts with (venv).

If the terminal ever says “python not found,” just make sure the venv is activated, or use the full path like you did before.

3) Start the app
streamlit run app.py


A browser tab opens at http://localhost:8501.

Keep this terminal running while you develop.

4) Edit the code

Click app.py in VS Code and make changes.

Save (Ctrl+S). Streamlit auto-reloads when you save.
If it doesn’t, click the “Rerun” button in the app.

5) Stop / restart the server (when needed)

In the terminal: Ctrl + C to stop Streamlit.

Start it again with:

streamlit run app.py

6) Typical “sit down to work” routine (quick version)

Open VS Code → folder streamlit_app

Terminal → .\venv\Scripts\Activate

streamlit run app.py

Edit → Save → Check browser → Repeat

Ctrl+C to stop when done

Common gotchas (and quick fixes)

No (venv) in terminal? Activate it: .\venv\Scripts\Activate

App won’t open / port in use? Stop previous server (Ctrl+C), then run again.

Changes not showing? Save file (Ctrl+S) or click Rerun in the app.

Module not found (e.g., pandas, plotly)? Install inside venv:

python -m pip install pandas plotly
